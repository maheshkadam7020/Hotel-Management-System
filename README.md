# Hotel-Management-System
This is a Java-based Hotel Management System developed using Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It allows hotel staff to efficiently manage room reservations. The system supports key functionalities such as:

Reserve a Room – Book a room by capturing guest details and stay duration.

View Reservation – Display all current reservations with room and guest information.

Get Room Number – Retrieve the assigned room number based on guest details or reservation ID.

Update Reservation – Modify reservation details such as dates or guest information.

Delete Reservation – Cancel an existing booking and free up the room.

This project provides a simple command-line interface, is fully database-connected using JDBC, and is ideal for learning Java CRUD operations with MySQL integration.
